Check out docs and recipe for more information. Experimental manual playback. Read more here . Add method Kohii.createControlDispatcher(Playback) . Read more here . Introduce PlayableObserver , Read more here . Introduce activeLifecycleState setting for the Manager. Default to State.STARTED . All the playbacks in a Manager can be played only if the lifecycle state of the Manager is at least this value. Experimental PlayerParameters , NetworkTypeChangeListener : the callback from a NetworkTypeChangeListener needs to return a PlayerParameters value so that the player can switch the video/audio quality, resolution, etc. Deprecate the VideoSize . Its value is no longer used anymore in the library. Experimental initialPlaybackInfo setting for the Binder. Setting this value will allow the Playback to start from a specific PlaybackInfo value. Experimental releaseOnInActive setting for the Binder. Setting this to false will let the Playback keep its state when it is inactive, but not yet detached from the Manager. Add method Playback.Controller.setupRenderer(Playback, Any?) and Playback.Controller.teardownRenderer(Playback, Any?) . Client can configure the renderer with custom manual control logic. Support Playback locking: if a Playback is locked, it will still be selected but will not be played. Add ExoPlayerCache to the kohii-exoplayer package. It can be used to obtain a pre-built Cache easily. Add TrackSelectorFactory , LoadControlFactory to the kohii-exoplayer package. Add ExoPlayerConfig to gather most of the detailed setting for a SimpleExoPlayer instance. Add createKohii convenient methods to easily create Kohii instance with custom parameters. Add Engine.lock* and Engine.unlock* methods to support manual lock/unlock an Activity/Manager/Bucket or Playback. Add a simple demonstration that builds TikTok-alike UI/UX: source code .

All the playbacks in a Manager can be played only if the lifecycle state of the Manager is at least this value. Experimental PlayerParameters , NetworkTypeChangeListener : the callback from a NetworkTypeChangeListener needs to return a PlayerParameters value so that the player can switch the video/audio quality, resolution, etc. Deprecate the VideoSize . Its value is no longer used anymore in the library. Experimental initialPlaybackInfo setting for the Binder. Setting this value will allow the Playback to start from a specific PlaybackInfo value. Experimental releaseOnInActive setting for the Binder. Setting this to false will let the Playback keep its state when it is inactive, but not yet detached from the Manager. Add method Playback.Controller.setupRenderer(Playback, Any?) and Playback.Controller.teardownRenderer(Playback, Any?) . Client can configure the renderer with custom manual control logic. Support Playback locking: if a Playback is locked, it will still be selected but will not be played. Add ExoPlayerCache to the kohii-exoplayer package.

Renderer and Container \u00b6 When we play a Video to a destination surface, we call that surface a Renderer . Some examples of a Renderer are VideoView in Android framework, PlayerView in ExoPlayer. A component that can contain a Renderer is called Container . If a PlayerView renderer is added directly to a FrameLayout , that FrameLayout is a container. In Kohii , by calling bind(someView) , you are placing your Video to a Container . The renderer can also be the container when it contains itself. Note Currently in Kohii , we only support ViewGroup containers, but theoretically it can be anything. In the future, we will try to expand the concept of container to other types. The idea of Renderer and Container allows Kohii to build the abstractions around them where a renderer can be attached to a container, detached from a container and passed around, and therefore renderers can be reused for unlimited number of Videos. This behavior is supported out of the box by kohii-exoplayer and kohii-androidx packages. Playback and Playable \u00b6 Playback is a component in Kohii , designed to manage the container. Like Fragment in the Android framework which (optionally) has a View and lifecycle , Playback manages a view which is the container, and it has a lifecycle controlled by another component called Manager . A Playback's lifecycle is scoped to the container's lifecycle and the Manager's lifecycle, which is as large as an Activity or a Fragment's lifecycle. When you place a Video in a container by calling bind(container) , Kohii allows you to have some configurations such as tag, delay, visible threshold by which the Video should start or pause, etc. These configurations are passed to the Playback, processed and passed down to lower layer to construct resources for an actual playback. So you can have a Video playing with one configuration in a container, but another configuration in another container. It is helpful when you want to switch a Video playback from list to full-screen and vice-versa. Playable is a component in Kohii , designed to manage the renderer. A Playable is created when the client calls bind(container) , and there is no Playable created previously for the same Video information. In other words, a Playable will be available when there is a Playback requests it. Kohii manages Playable globally, which means that its lifecycle is scoped to the Application lifetime. But once a Playable is no longer needed , it will be destroyed. In Kohii , when a Playable is not used by any Playback, it will be released and scheduled to be destroyed. Though, during transient states like configuration change, current Playback will be destroyed (because its container is destroyed) and new Playback is still under construction, Kohii will give the Playable a few more time to wait for a Playback to request it. After this duration, if a Playable is not requested, Kohii will destroy it to reclaim its memory. The idea of Playable and Playback allows client to use the same Video and player resource for different renderers, which help to reduce the memory usage and enable developers to build complicated scenarios much easier. Bucket, Manager and Group \u00b6 Considering an Application where you have an Activity contains 3 Fragments: A, B and C. A has a RecyclerView (named RA) contains a lot of Videos. B has a ScrollView (named SB) contains many Videos and another RecyclerView (named RB) contains many Videos too. You only want RB to start playing the Videos automatically, and later you want to disable the Video playback of RB and enable it for RA. Kohii makes this possible by using a number of management components: Bucket, Manager and Group. Bucket is a component designed to manage a big View component like RecyclerView , NestedScrollView or ViewPager . Bucket is built by the Manager from the View it manages. And it has the responsibility to tell Manager about UI updates, as well as to select which Video to play from all Videos it knows about. The View is called the root of a Bucket . You can setup any View to be the root of a Bucket. A simple FrameLayout can be the root for a Bucket of all the Renderers it contains. Most of the time you want to use the most suitable root for your use case. For example, in your screen you have a RecyclerView whose each child is a FrameLayout with a PlayerView in it. Either the RecyclerView or each of its FrameLayout children can be the root of a Bucket, but if you want to manage all the Videos at once, you need to use build the Bucket from the RecyclerView. Kohii has built-in factory methods to build Bucket for RecyclerView , NestedScrollView , ViewPager , ViewPager2 and the general ViewGroup . You can have many Bucket in a single screen to enable complicated behavior. For example: when a RecyclerView with many Videos is nested in another RecyclerView, you can build the Bucket for both the RecyclerViews to control the Videos of the nested one. Manager is a component designed to manage a Fragment or an Activity which contains big View*s using Buckets. Manager creates and manages Buckets for Views on demand. You only need to create Bucket for the View whose Video need to be controlled. So in our scenario above, Fragment B only need to register the RecyclerView to **Kohii* , the Manager will then acknowledge this RecyclerView and create a Bucket for it. Manager also manages all Playbacks in all Buckets, and closely communicates with the Group about any UI change. Group is as important as an Activity in Android framework. It contains many Managers just like an Activity can contain many Fragments , and it listens to Managers request to refresh the overall state. Because we will only allow a small number of videos from one Bucket of one Manager at a time to be playing, Group exists to take care of playback state of all Managers , and will carefully update the whole screen (i.e the Activity ) accordingly. Master, Engine \u00b6 Master is the component that controls everything used by the library. In short term, it is the brain of Kohii . There will be only one Master instance exists at one time. It controls the Playable's lifecycle, including destroying them when they are not needed anymore. It manages all the Groups of an Application, dispatch the playback events and so on. The client should never need to access the Master directly. Engine is a component that connects the client with the Master. An Engine has 3 important responsibilities: to initialize other important components like Managers, Groups, to help the client to bind the Video resource to a Container, and to build Playable for the Video. Most of the time, developer only needs to work with the Engine. You can also build custom Engine for your need.","title":"Glossary"},{"location":"glossary/#glossary","text":"This section helps you to understand the core concepts of Kohii .","title":"Glossary"},{"location":"glossary/#renderer-and-container","text":"When we play a Video to a destination surface, we call that surface a Renderer . Some examples of a Renderer are VideoView in Android framework, PlayerView in ExoPlayer. A component that can contain a Renderer is called Container . If a PlayerView renderer is added directly to a FrameLayout , that FrameLayout is a container. In Kohii , by calling bind(someView) , you are placing your Video to a Container . The renderer can also be the container when it contains itself. Note Currently in Kohii , we only support ViewGroup containers, but theoretically it can be anything. In the future, we will try to expand the concept of container to other types. The idea of Renderer and Container allows Kohii to build the abstractions around them where a renderer can be attached to a container, detached from a container and passed around, and therefore renderers can be reused for unlimited number of Videos. This behavior is supported out of the box by kohii-exoplayer and kohii-androidx packages.","title":"Renderer and Container"},{"location":"glossary/#playback-and-playable","text":"Playback is a component in Kohii , designed to manage the container. Like Fragment in the Android framework which (optionally) has a View and lifecycle , Playback manages a view which is the container, and it has a lifecycle controlled by another component called Manager . A Playback's lifecycle is scoped to the container's lifecycle and the Manager's lifecycle, which is as large as an Activity or a Fragment's lifecycle. When you place a Video in a container by calling bind(container) , Kohii allows you to have some configurations such as tag, delay, visible threshold by which the Video should start or pause, etc. These configurations are passed to the Playback, processed and passed down to lower layer to construct resources for an actual playback. So you can have a Video playing with one configuration in a container, but another configuration in another container. It is helpful when you want to switch a Video playback from list to full-screen and vice-versa. Playable is a component in Kohii , designed to manage the renderer. A Playable is created when the client calls bind(container) , and there is no Playable created previously for the same Video information. In other words, a Playable will be available when there is a Playback requests it. Kohii manages Playable globally, which means that its lifecycle is scoped to the Application lifetime. But once a Playable is no longer needed , it will be destroyed. In Kohii , when a Playable is not used by any Playback, it will be released and scheduled to be destroyed. Though, during transient states like configuration change, current Playback will be destroyed (because its container is destroyed) and new Playback is still under construction, Kohii will give the Playable a few more time to wait for a Playback to request it. After this duration, if a Playable is not requested, Kohii will destroy it to reclaim its memory. The idea of Playable and Playback allows client to use the same Video and player resource for different renderers, which help to reduce the memory usage and enable developers to build complicated scenarios much easier.","title":"Playback and Playable"},{"location":"glossary/#bucket-manager-and-group","text":"Considering an Application where you have an Activity contains 3 Fragments: A, B and C. A has a RecyclerView (named RA) contains a lot of Videos. B has a ScrollView (named SB) contains many Videos and another RecyclerView (named RB) contains many Videos too. You only want RB to start playing the Videos automatically, and later you want to disable the Video playback of RB and enable it for RA. Kohii makes this possible by using a number of management components: Bucket, Manager and Group. Bucket is a component designed to manage a big View component like RecyclerView , NestedScrollView or ViewPager . Bucket is built by the Manager from the View it manages. And it has the responsibility to tell Manager about UI updates, as well as to select which Video to play from all Videos it knows about. The View is called the root of a Bucket . You can setup any View to be the root of a Bucket. A simple FrameLayout can be the root for a Bucket of all the Renderers it contains. Most of the time you want to use the most suitable root for your use case. For example, in your screen you have a RecyclerView whose each child is a FrameLayout with a PlayerView in it.

This means: rotating the device, switching to multi-windows mode or opening full-screen player doesn\\'t trigger pausing/resuming the playback.

Thinking that playing thousands of videos in sequence just using one PlayerView instance . Scoped volume configuration. This means: you can set volume value of one Video, and apply the same for others, depending on the scope you want. The scope can be just that Video, or all Videos in the same RecyclerView/ScrollView , or all Videos in the same Activity . Rich features demo app: demo and guidelines for creating various UX/UI patterns, from simple to complicated, including Picture-In-Picture playback or Scroll-To-Mini-Player UX just like YouTube app. For advance developers Kohii API is highly abstracted. You can easily extend it to support non-ExoPlayer API, or more complicated playback API. There is demo on how to use this YouTube player library in Kohii. The idea of Playback Continuity \u00b6 The concept Playback Continuity comes when I prepared for the Tokyo DroidKaigi 2019 where I will also talk about the same topic. Its idea was in my mind for a long time ago. Thinking about a Video playback, what are the common scenarios: Single, individual playback, like watching a movie on Netflix or YouTube. Multiple playback, like viewing many videos on a timeline like Facebook, and watch them one by one while scrolling through the list. All of these scenarios must share some common behaviors: Features \u00b6 0. Rich feature demo application \u00b6 As always, I try to cover as much of the capabilities of the library as possible in the demo app. By that, you can have the recommended ways to implement many patterns using Kohii , including: Using Kohii in RecyclerView only (the simplest pattern). Using Kohii in NestedScrollView only (yes, Kohii does not just support RecyclerView, it works with any ViewGroup you can imagine of, or, most of them). Using Kohii in ViewPager only, where each page is a Fragment (this is one of the thing that toro could not support well, so Kohii is here for the rescue). Using Kohii in Master/Detail UI composition (this is a new pattern I\\'m experimenting with, and it needs time to be battle proof, and it needs your feedback to be mature <3). Using Kohii in RecyclerView, with 'click-to-fullscreen' feature like YouTube UI. This is the game changer, my selling point for Kohii <3. Implementation of it is also discussed in this post . Using Kohii in RecyclerView, with 'click-to-fullscreen' feature that open the fullscreen playback in new Activity , without pausing/resuming the playback . So starting new Activity for fullscreen player will not interrupt your playback UX, sounds good huh? Using Kohii in RecyclerView, with 'click-to-fullscreen' feature that open the fullscreen playback in new Fragment , because single Activity is the new trend. To make it more fun, I also add the fragment transition learnt from here . And more to come, depending on the feedback I got, request I receive and time I have to spend. 1. Few-line setup, full auto \u00b6 Thinking that you just need the following lines to integrate fully automatic Video playback in to your App: // Init Kohii for Fragment or Activity val kohii = Kohii [ this /* fragment or activity instance */ ] kohii . register ( this , arrayOf ( recyclerView )) // register the RecyclerView to be a 'host' of our Videos. // In ViewHolder or Adapter's onBindViewHolder, where kohii instance is passed from above kohii . setUp ( videoUrl ). bind ( playerView ) // playerView is instance of ExoPlayer's PlayerView. This is the fastest way to use Kohii . With this setup, you got: Videos will be played/paused automatically on user's scroll. The top-most PlayerView whose visible area is equal to, or more than 65% of its area will be the one to play, all other PlayerView instances will be paused. Configuration changes like multi-windows mode, orientation change etc will not interupt the playback. (As the matter of fact, SurfaceView or TextureView used in PlayerView will be recreated, so you will see the glitch of the Video image frame, but the Audio will keep playing during the configuration change). Under the hood: Resource for Video playback is initialized as late as possible, so there is little to no impact to app's UX. Resource for Video playback is cached for reusability, so playback switching will be as fast as possible. Cached resource will be released as soon as possible, so there is no concern about memory leak. All playback logic, ExoPlayer implementation are provided by Kohii. You don't need to worry about anything. Digging in the API, you will have more control over the playback behavior, including: Repeat mode, which is the same with that of ExoPlayer. Delay, which help you to start the Playback with an amount of delay. Visible area of the PlayerView that trigger the playback. It is 65% by default, but you are free to change it. Initial playback info, so you can control the starting position, volume of a playback. And more. 2. Reusing PlayerView instance, with the same amount of code \u00b6 Yes, you read it correctly. Now you can reuse PlayerView instance across many Video playback. This is something toro could not archive, due to the limitation of its design. And as it is highly requested , Kohii is my answer to the problem. Changing the setup before to this // Init Kohii for Fragment or Activity val kohii = Kohii [ this /* fragment or activity instance */ ] kohii . register ( this , arrayOf ( recyclerView )) // register the RecyclerView to be a 'host' of our Videos. // In ViewHolder or Adapter's onBindViewHolder, where kohii instance is passed from above kohii . setUp ( videoUrl ). bind ( playerViewContainer ) // playerViewContainer is a ViewGroup to put PlayerView instance on demand. Just changing from using a PlayerView instance directly to using a container , you are done. To help you understand this feature, let\\'s talk about the why real quick: why reusing PlayerView instance is that cool? . If you take a look on the issue I mention above , go from bottom-up because it is a long issue to read through, you can see the discussion about reusing stuff in the ExoPlayer & RecyclerView combination . Yes, it is important to reuse as much as possible, to keep a smooth user experience, as well as to save memory. Assuming that you use PlayerView in your ViewHolder to play the video. If your viewport has 3 ~ 4 ViewHolders that contains Video, there will be at most one PlayerView that is playing at a time, and at least 2 ~ 3 PlayerView instances doing nothing, but still keeping an expensive Surface object alive. We know that creating and keeping Surface are expensive operations, so reusing the Surface is a reasonable requirement. How Kohii supports this: The required step is client provides the container to Kohii using the code above. The container can be just a FrameLayout. Kohii keeps a pool of PlayerView that will create the PlayerView instance on demand, and keep the cache of up to 2 instances of it, in the Activity's lifecycle scope. So once the Activity is destroyed, the pool is automatically cleared, again, no fear of memory leak. Kohii knows when the PlayerView should appear, and when it should not . When the PlayerView is demanded, Kohii acquires one instance from the pool. If there is no cached instance, a new instance will be created. On one hand, this instance will be passed to the playback engine, and on the other hand, it will be added to the container by internal mechanism. When the PlayerView should disappear, Kohii will remove it from the container , and release it back to the pool for reuse. Because there will be at most one PlayerView to play at a time, and Kohii's pool keeps up to 2 instances at a time, there will be at most 2 PlayerView instances living at a moment. (In practice, depends on how complicated your video content is, there will be more. For example you have both DRM content and non-DRM content, and you want to use TextureView for non-DRM ones, then Kohii keeps 2 pools for 2 types of playback). The caveat of this mechanism is that by default you do not control the way a PlayerView is created (spoiler: with more lines of code, you can). With more advance setup, you have the following control: How to add and remove PlayerView instance to/from the container . Because your container may contains other Views, Kohii allows you to provide your way to handle this operation. How to create PlayerView instance, because you may have your custom PlayerView implementation. 3. Manual control \u00b6 Some of the requirement I got from toro are the abilities to: Manually control the playback using UI/buttons Mute/Un-mute one playback and apply that to all Those 2 control can be gathered in one group: manual playback control, with scope. Kohii provides the following behaviors to make it possible: Allow client to configure so that, user can fully control the video playback, without any help by Kohii. For instance: when your RecyclerView is shown, and the first ViewHolder is a Video and it is fully visible. This behavior will not start the playback automatically, user can start/pause/do anything with the playback using client-provide UI controller. Once user scrolls the Video so that it is no longer visible on screen, Kohii will not do anything to pause or release the playback. If it was playing before, it keeps playing. If it was paused before, it keeps being paused. But once the Activity that contains this playback is destroyed, Kohii will correctly clear any resource in use. And even better, the manual playback is retained across configuration change, without any interuption. Allow client to configure so that, user can control the playback on the fly. This means that: Kohii will still start the playback automatically, but once user click to some buttons to pause it, Kohii will not change that state. So a video paused by user, even if it is fully visible, will not be played automatically (in full-auto config, Kohii will start this playback). When user scrolls the Video so that it is no longer visible enough, Kohii will do its jobs to pause and release resource if needed. And when user scrolls the Video back to visible enough, Kohii will put the playback to its previous state: if it was playing before being scrolled off-screen, it will be resumed; if it was paused before being scrolled off-screen, it keeps being paused. About the volume control, it works in a bit different way: Kohii allows client to apply a volume value by scope . There are 4 scopes in Kohii, but to not go too deep, I will just talk about 2: playback scope, and global scope. If client applies a volume value to playback scope , then only the receiver playback object will have this new volume value. But if client applies a volume value to global scope , then all currently playing playbacks, and any playback that will be created next will have the new volume value. The control flow is easy to imagine, but not easy to implementation. What I did for Kohii is one of my best thing I have ever done. And I hope it helps you to solve your problems.","title":"Intro"},{"location":"intro/#tl-dr","text":"Kohii is a library that: Is built for Android, supports Android 4.4 (SDK 19) and up.

Second, add this in your RecyclerView.Adapter#onBindViewHolder , or corresponding place in ViewHolder Kotlin // You need to pass the kohii instance here kohii . setUp ( videoUrl ). bind ( playerView ) Java // You need to pass the kohii instance here kohii . setUp ( videoUrl ). bind ( playerView ); Done, you have what you want. But before leaving, let's discover the details below with your curiousity. Before you start: thinking in Kohii \u00b6 It is important that you get the concept of Kohii before we go further. Because the way you think about Video playback until now would be different to what Kohii thinks. Until now, you may see and/or use the following pattern: videoView . setVideoPath ( videoUrl ) This line reads : I have a VideoView and I will play a Video in it by calling setVideoPath method. In Kohii , the direction is opposite: kohii . setUp ( videoUrl ). bind ( videoView ) This line reads: I have a Video and I will play it in a VideoView. Let's setup the Video and bind it to the VideoView. The difference here is: who is the main actor ? In traditional way, the VideoView owns the Video and therefore, when it dies, we also lose the Video playback. In Kohii , we let the Video be the active part. It acknowledges the VideoView it will be played on. So when the VideoView dies, your Video can be smoothly switched to other VideoView . To give you an imagine about why it is good this way, consider this scenario: you have a list of Videos, and you want to open one Video in fullscreen, smoothly . Thinking in traditional way : How I can open this VideoView (which is now in the list) in fullscreen? If I use other VideoView I will need to call that setVideoPath again and it will create new resource and stuff and the playback will be reloaded, and so on... We see some challenges here already. While thinking in Kohii way , it sounds easier: How can I open this Video (which is now in the list) in fullscreen? Can I just switch it from current VideoView to the fullscreen VideoView ? This way of thinking is the base for all the abstractions in Kohii . How this idea comes to life will be discussed later. Now that you have the concept about Kohii , let's get our hands dirty. Preparation \u00b6 This section will use some assumptions below: You will use Kohii in Fragment (the usage will be the same in Activity ). You use ExoPlayer for the playback (implementation provided via kohii-exoplayer extension). You own the content or have enough rights to use them. Kohii has no responsibility about how you use it in your app. First, you need to initialize a few things so that Kohii makes sense of your application. \u25a0 Initialize Kohii instance Kohii should be used as a Global instance. You can get it as follow: Kotlin val kohii = Kohii [ this @Fragment ] // or using Context also works: val kohii = Kohii[requireContext()] Java Kohii kohii = Kohii . get ( this ); // or using Context: Kohii kohii = Kohii.get(requireContext()); As a singleton , Kohii instance can be passed around or re-obtained in other Fragment . You can also use dependency injection library like Dagger to prepare a global instance, and inject it to required places. \u25a0 Register necessary objects to Kohii Kohii needs to know about a few things to work properly: Where you are using Kohii from? A Fragment or Activity ? Line below answers that question: Kotlin // From the Fragment's onViewCreated() kohii . register ( this @Fragment ) Java // From the Fragment's onViewCreated() kohii . register ( this ); The line above also return a Manager object. It is useful in some advance usages, but we don't need it for now. Which ViewGroup contains Videos? We call that ViewGroup a Bucket . Because you may have more than one bucket in your Fragment , and not all of them need to be tracked by Kohii , you should only register ones you care about. Code for it is as below: Kotlin kohii . register ( this @Fragment ) // or manager . addBucket ( recyclerView ) . addBucket ( anotherRecyclerView ) // yeah, 2 RVs in one Fragment, why not. Java kohii . register ( this ) // or manager . addBucket ( recyclerView ) . addBucket ( anotherRecyclerView ); // yeah, 2 RVs in one Fragment, why not. It is enough setting up for this session. Next, we will setup the Video for each ViewHolder. Integration \u00b6 To make it works, you need only one line: Kotlin // You must pass the kohii instance here // playerView is the PlayerView you want to play your Video on kohii . setUp ( videoUrl ). bind ( playerView ) Java // You must pass the kohii instance here // playerView is the PlayerView you want to play your Video on kohii . setUp ( videoUrl ). bind ( playerView ); But let's understand the concept behind: In the one line above: kohii.setUp(videoUrl) turns the url to a Binder object which can be used to bind to a container . Once you finish the setup, you have the Video to be automatically played/paused once user scrolls the list such that the container is visible more (will play) or less (will pause) than 65% of its area. Also, to ensure the playback is automatic, if the renderer is a PlayerView Kohii will forcefully disable the PlayerView 's PlayerControlView even if you set it before. To have manual playback control enabled, you need some additional configuration which will be discussed in other session.","title":"Basic usages"},{"location":"usage-basic/#basic-usages","text":"","title":"Basic usages"},{"location":"usage-basic/#the-scenario","text":"This basic usage session will guide you step-by-step to complete this scenario: you have a Fragment with many Videos in a vertical RecyclerView .
