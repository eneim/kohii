/**
 * A [Playable] contains necessary information about a [Media] item, and the config provided by
 * client for it to start the media with expected result. Instance of [Playable] is provided by
 * [PlayableCreator].
 *
 * An implementation of [Playable] must take into account about the following points:
 *
 * - A [Playable] is managed at application scope. So it must not retain any reference to narrower
 * scope like [androidx.fragment.app.Fragment] or [android.app.Activity].
 * - A [Playable] must acknowledge about configuration changes. It must return a correct value
 * from [onConfigChange] so that the system can provide proper resource management. For example if
 * any of its resource needs to be reset at configuration change, its [onConfigChange] method must
 * return `false`.
 *
 * [AbstractPlayable] is a base implementation that leverage actual playback logic to a [Bridge].
 *
 * @see [AbstractPlayable]
