# Advance usages

Advance usages session will focus on using **Kohii** with **ExoPlayer**. Using others _extensions_ will be discussed in more advance topics, because each extension is built with different ability.

Here, we assume that you are familiar with **ExoPlayer**, including its core components (Player, ExoPlayer, SimpleExoPlayer, MediaSource, etc) and UI system (PlayerView, PlayerControlView, ControlDispatcher, etc).

This section may use some keywords about components in **Kohii** like **Container**, **Bucket**, etc. You can find their definitions here: [Components](../../customize/terms).
